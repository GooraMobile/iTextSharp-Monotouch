##iTextSharp-Monotouch 5.4.2##

iTextSharp for Monotouch - This is the last version available iTextSharp 5.4.2


To compile this library I have to comment all the code about Barcode because there is reference to System.Drawing.Drawinf2D.
If someone needs it can work on this version to find a way to add barcode generation.

In the solution there is a sample iphone app to test iTextSharp Library.
